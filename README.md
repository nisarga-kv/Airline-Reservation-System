The Airline Reservation System is a software-based application developed to manage and automate the booking and scheduling of airline flights, providing users with a convenient platform for reserving tickets and managing flight information. This system aims to replace traditional manual booking processes by offering a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly interface for passengers, airline staff, and administrators. The core functionality includes searching for available flights, booking and cancelling tickets, checking seat availability, viewing flight schedules, and managing passenger details. Typically built using technologies such as Java or Python for the backend and MySQL or SQLite for database management, the system ensures secure and efficient storage of large volumes of flight and passenger data. The project may also include modules for user authentication, payment integration, ticket generation, and reporting. An admin panel allows authorized personnel to manage flights, routes, pricing, and monitor system activity. By implementing this project, developers gain hands-on experience in building real-time database-driven applications, and it serves as a model for understanding how commercial airline systems operate behind the scenes. The Airline Reservation System not only enhances the overall booking experience for users but also improves operational efficiency and reduces the scope for human error in managing complex airline logistics
